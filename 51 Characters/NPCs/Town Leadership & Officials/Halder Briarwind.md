Halder is a broad-shouldered man in his late fifties with sun-toughened skin and hands like cracked leather. His beard is more dust than color now, and his hair is thinning, usually hidden beneath a sweat-stained wide-brimmed hat. He wears the same patchworked overalls and heavy boots day after day, dirt caked into the seams like it belongs there. His gait is slow but sure, and he smells faintly of hay, smoke, and damp earth.



Though he holds no official title, Halder Briarwind is regarded as the beating heart of Oar’s Break. His sprawling farm feeds half the town, and when Halder speaks, even the mayor listens—begrudgingly. He doesn't meddle in politics, but he knows how to apply pressure when a field goes unplowed or a shipment gets delayed. Fair but firm, Halder commands respect not through charisma but through quiet presence and consistency. Townsfolk seek him for advice, shelter, or a place to work when times are lean. He rarely raises his voice, but when he does, the conversation ends. <br><br> Some say the farm keeps him grounded. Others suspect the real reason he never leaves its borders has more to do with a long-forgotten feud buried somewhere out in the fields.
